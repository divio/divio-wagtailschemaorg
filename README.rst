wagtail-schema.org
==================

Add Schema.org JSON-LD to your Wagtail website.

See https://github.com/takeflight/wagtail-schema.org for details of how to use wagtail-schema.org.

Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google,
Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.

wagtail-schema.orgÂ supports two types of schema entities: site-wide entities and page-specific entities.

Site-wide entities might be the organisation that the site as a whole is about, while page-specific entities might be a
single person that the page in question is about. Both sets of entities are optional, and sites can implement only
those that make sense.
